This repo is for the code written for the Computational Lab at University of
Pisa.
This is a work in progress, the main topic will be the implementation of the
Propp-Wilson for the study of the Ising model.

Keywords: Propp-Wilson, Markov chain, MCMC, Coupling from the past, Ising model

A short description for the scripts:
- `vanilla_mcmc.py`: here I use a simple Monte Carlo method with Markov Chains
  for generating a target distribution over a finite set of states.
